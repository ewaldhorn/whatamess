# Go Memory Cache

An in-memory cache for running Go applications.

Based on an article by [Alex Edwards](https://www.alexedwards.net/blog/implementing-an-in-memory-cache-in-go), with some modifications by me.

## Running

Use [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) to manage the building, running and testing of the project.
