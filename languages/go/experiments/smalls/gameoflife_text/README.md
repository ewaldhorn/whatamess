# Game of Life in Go - Console version

I often write a simple Game of Life implementation when I'm learning a new language. It's a good way
to learn about structures, flow control etc. in any language.  Considering how well-known the algorithm
is, it's a simple and easy way to compare different languages as well.

In this case, I opted to use the console for output, so as to not get distracted by the code needed
to implement a GUI.

In a subsequent experiment, I will make a more graphical UI, perhaps something that can also be run
on the web in a browser.
