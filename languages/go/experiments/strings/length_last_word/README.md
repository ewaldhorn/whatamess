# Length of the last word

Build a Go function that will find the length of the last word in a string.

## Examples

`This is easy` - 4
`Not   much harder` - 6
```Now, this probably    a bit  harder now ` - 3
```   Ano ther bi t of a challenge      ` - 9

So basically, find the last word, irrespective of spacing, and calculate its length.

## Bonus points - don't create new data structures

In other words, don't create a list of words...
