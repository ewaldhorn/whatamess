# Simple sprite movement using the keyboard and Ebitengine

Based on the original tutorial by [Frank's Laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYf_JwzwTlQ), and as translated to Go by [Jes Fink-Jensen](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-code-a-simple-game-in-golang-and-fyne-bff184bee9ef).

## Concept

Moving sprites around a the screen, overlaid on a background image, using the keyboard. While not
a game in it's own right, it does serve as a nice skeleton for many basic types of games.

## Liberties

I've taken some liberties with the code, of course!
