# Iso8583 in Go

I need to process some [Iso8583](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8583) transaction data for a project and thought it's a good opportunity to see if I can do this in [Go](https://go.dev/) instead of my usual Java tools.

## Running

Install [Task](https://taskfile.dev) and then you have convenient scripts in the `Taskfile.yml` file.

- `run` to run the main code
- `test` to run the suite of tests
