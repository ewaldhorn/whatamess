# Heap Data Structure
A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property:
the parent node is either greater than (max heap) or less than (min heap) its child nodes.
This ordering allows for efficient extraction of the maximum or minimum element.

## Types of Heaps
  - Max Heap: The parent node is greater than its child nodes.
  - Min Heap: The parent node is less than its child nodes.

## Heap Operations
  - Insert: Add a new element to the heap while maintaining the heap property.
  - Extract: Remove and return the maximum (max heap) or minimum (min heap) element.
  - Heapify: Rearrange the heap to maintain the heap property after insertion or extraction.

## Importance of Heaps
  - Efficient Sorting: Heapsort, a comparison-based sorting algorithm, uses a heap to sort elements in O(n log n) time.
  - Priority Queues: Heaps are used to implement priority queues, where elements are ordered based on their priority.
  - Graph Algorithms: Heaps are used in graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm and Prim's algorithm to efficiently select the next node to visit.
  - Event Handling: Heaps can be used to manage events in a system, where events are ordered based on their priority or timestamp.

## Real-World Applications
- Resource Allocation: Heaps can be used to allocate resources, such as memory or CPU time, based on priority.
- Scheduling: Heaps can be used to schedule tasks or jobs based on their priority or deadline.
- Traffic Management: Heaps can be used to manage traffic flow, where vehicles are prioritized based on their type or urgency.

In summary, heaps are a fundamental data structure in computer science, providing an
efficient way to manage and prioritize elements. Their importance lies in their ability
to support efficient sorting, priority queuing, and graph algorithms, making them a crucial
component in many real-world applications.
