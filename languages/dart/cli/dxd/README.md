# DXD

Simple clone of `xxd` in Dart. It's more of an experiment than a production-level tool for now.

## Why

Well, there's no good reason, other than wanting to do some basic CLI work with Dart to see how that would work. There's
more and more demand for me to use Dart outside the Flutter world, hence these little experiments.
