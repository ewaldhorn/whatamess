# JQuery, of all things

I know, I know, I know.  It's 2023 (or later!) and there's JQuery stuff here. Sorry!

## But why

Because some of the UI's I'm porting from Electron-based apps to Fyne (Golang) use JQuery and to be
honest it's been so long since I've used it, that I'm not even always sure what it's doing.

## Really, why

In order to recreate the effects and capabilities of the web-based interfaces in a desktop app, where
it makes sense, I need to understand what the original app did, how it did it and why. Since a lot of
JQuery was used on this project, I need to refresh my JQuery.

## Are you even sorry

You betcha!
