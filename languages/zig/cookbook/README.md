# Zig CookBook

I'm working my way through the [Zig CookBook](https://zigcc.github.io/zig-cookbook/) to refresh my Zig a little bit. 

This is an interesting and rapidly changing language and I'm finding that even though I've done some work in Zig,
I just don't know enough about it and am constantly discovering better ways of working!
