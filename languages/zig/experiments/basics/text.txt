This file contains some text.
Some lines are long.
Some are short.
This one, for example, does not count as one of the short lines.
This one could, but, alas, it does not.

The line above this one is blank.
Actually, the line below this one is blank as well.

So, there you have it.
A file with text.
And this is the last line!
