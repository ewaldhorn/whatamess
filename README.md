# Just an absolute MESS of experiments

Best not to look too closely if you value your mental health.

## PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE NOTE

These are _experiments_, often in some state of flux. I might
try something that I am thinking of doing a talk about, or do
some "scratchpad" work while doing a course. Or I'm just high
on sugar and crafting bugs. Anything goes.

*Rather not run this stuff on your own computer!*
