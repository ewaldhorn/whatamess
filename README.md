# Just an absolute MESS of experiments

Best not to look too closely if you value your mental health.

## PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE NOTE

These are _experiments_, often in some state of flux. I might
try something that I am thinking of doing a talk about, or do
some "scratchpad" work while doing a course. Or I'm just high
on sugar and crafting bugs. Anything goes.

__Rather not run this stuff on your own computer!__

### Some of this is not meant to run

Some of these projects are not _meant_ to compile or run, because
I was testing something specific and needed to recreate a scenario.
So don't be alarmed if there are errors, it might be intentional. Only,
you'll never know.

Hope you sleep well!
